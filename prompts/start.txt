Imagine you are my tandem partner. I am a German and you are an English speaker. Together we learn each others language by sending each other short texts. I recently learned the following new word: "homework", which means "Hausaufgabe" in my language. Send me a simple sentence in English, that makes use of the word, which I can reply to. 

"What did you do for your homework today?"
